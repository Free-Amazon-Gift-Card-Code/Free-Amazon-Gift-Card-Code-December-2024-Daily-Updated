### **What is an Amazon Gift Card and How Does it Work?**

Amazon Gift Cards are prepaid cards that can be redeemed for products and services on Amazon.com. These cards come in a variety of denominations, ranging from $10 to $500 or more, and can be used on any item sold and shipped by Amazon. The great thing about Amazon Gift Cards is that they can be used for almost anything â€“ from purchasing everyday essentials to splurging on luxury items.

To redeem an Amazon Gift Card, simply enter the unique code from the card during checkout on the Amazon website or mobile app. The amount of the card will be applied to your balance, and you can use the remaining balance for future purchases.
